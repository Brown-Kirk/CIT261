		***Variables: Variables are placeholders. They can be numbers, strings, objects, boolean, null, or undefined.
		***Variables are always defined by putting "var" in front of the variable name.
		***To assign a value to a variable, you put an "=" followed by the value.
		***Initially, a variable can be declared and a value assigned, or it can be declared without a value.
		***Declaring without a value actually assigns the value "undefined".
		***Example "var variableName;" creates the variable "variableName" and assigns the value "undefined".
		***Example "var variableName = 12" creates the variable "variableName" and assigns the numerical value of 12.
		***In the example below, "valueList" is assigned the value "undefined", but specifies that this is an array.
		***More on arrays later

		/*
		***	Functions are a collection of actions that can be called from other areas of the script. These
		*** can perform any actions any other area of the script can, but are reusable. So you can call the function
		*** from other areas of the script, as many times as you want. In this case, the function "getValueInputs"
		*** gets the value entered into a text box, then takes that value to perform additional actions such as
		*** checking to see if it is a number, if it is between 1 and 100,000, and then passing it on to other functions.

			***Conditional Statements: Conditional statements define actions to take based upon the conditions present.
			***These can take several forms
			***		"if.. else"  - This statement checks to see if a condition is true. You can check for variables to be
			***			a certain value, greater than or less than a certain value, or even what type of value it is.
			***			In the example below, the code checks for 3 things and if all of them are true, it returns true.
			***			The three things are: Is the value anything besides a number, is the value less than 1, is the value
			***			greater than 100,000. As long as it meets any of these, the value is true. If any one of these is true,
			***			it returns true. (You could put "&&" where "||" is to mean it has to meet ALL criteria.)
			***			For example, the value "Bob" is not a number, so it would return true, and thus proceed to the true
			***			actions where it says the input is not valid. "-500" is less than 1, so it would do the same. 150,000
			***			is greater than 100000, so it would also. However, "50" causes it to return false because it does Not
			***			meet any of the criteria. In this case, we proceed with the "oddSum()" function. We could put "else if"
			***			where "else" is and add in another condition, if we wanted. There can be as many "else if" as you wanted
			***			but only 1 if and 1 else.
